## Governance constants (always true)

- Serial inference: ONE Ollama model at a time. api/ps check before every dispatch. ollama stop after.
- No frontier models: GPT/Gemini/Grok/GLM forbidden. Local quorum (gemma4:31b, qwen3.6:27b, granite4.1:30b, nemotron-super) is the governance witness.
- Authority chain: CLAUDE.md -> canon/ -> operator-context.md -> this file -> RAG
